## Contributing
#### At Home
Contribute as normal.
#### During an Event
A new system has been put in place to allow version control during rapid development at events.\
To use this system:
1. BEFORE the Event, create a new branch called "event_{EVENT_NAME}", replacing {EVENT_NAME} with the current event's name.
2. Deploy the code as you normally would at the event.
<!-- -->
Commits will be automatically created per each deploy. 
Their names being timestamps of that deploy.\
